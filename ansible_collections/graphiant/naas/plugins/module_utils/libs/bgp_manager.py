"""
BGP Manager for Graphiant Playbooks.

This module handles BGP peering configuration management,
including bgp multipath, route aggregations and routing-policy attachment/detachment.

Config lives under:
  edge.segments.<segment>.bgpNeighbors
  edge.segments.<segment>.bgpAggregations
  edge.segments.<segment>.ebgpMultipath
  edge.routePolicies                     (device-level global policy attachment)

Idempotency: configure/deconfigure/detach_policies each fetch the device's current
state via get_device_info and compare the intended change (per segment + neighbor /
aggregation) against what is already on the device. If the desired state already
matches, the config push for that device is skipped. Note: BGP MD5 passwords are
excluded from the comparison because the GET API never returns the secret value.
