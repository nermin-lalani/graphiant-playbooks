module: graphiant_data_assurance
short_description: Manage Graphiant Data Assurance policies
description:
  - Create, update, or delete Graphiant Data Assurance policies via the portal API.
  - Reads a structured YAML config file and applies the desired state to the Graphiant portal.
  - >-
    Both assurance policies (with C(flexAlgo)) and block-by-URL/app policies (without
    C(flexAlgo)) are entries in the C(DataAssurancePolicies) list and are sent to the
    C(/v1/data/assurance/assurances/global) endpoint.
  - >-
    Block-by-category policies are entries in the C(ContentFilterPolicies) list and are sent to
    the C(/v1/global/content-filters) endpoint. Each blocks one or more domain C(categories)
    (by name, resolved to a domain category ID) with an optional C(allowedUrlList) ("Allowed URL
    List") applied as per-category exception wildcards. Both lists are managed by the same module
    and operations from a single config file.
  - "Configure is idempotent: compares the intended config against live portal state and"
  - "skips the update when already matched."
  - "Deconfigure is idempotent: policies not found are silently skipped."
  - >-
    Deleting a policy is a two-step flow: the portal requires a policy to be unassigned from all
    sites before deletion, so the module first updates it to a detached config (no sites, empty
    apps/rules) and then deletes it.
  - >-
    With C(ansible-playbook --check), writes are skipped but C(changed) reflects whether
    an apply would modify at least one policy. Use C(--diff) to preview C(details.diff_plan).
notes:
  - >-
    Site scoping: use C(useAllSites: true) to apply a policy to all enterprise sites, or
    C(siteListName: "<name>") to scope it to a named site list. The module resolves the
    name to the portal site list ID and raises an error if it is not found.
  - >-
    C(flexAlgo) is the flex-algo name that defines the SLA metric for path selection
    (e.g. C(test-all-cores), C(hestia-all-cores)). Use
    V(/v1/data/assurance/flex-algos) to list available values. Omit for block/protection
    policies. When specified, the name is validated against the flex-algos that exist in
    the enterprise; the module fails with an error listing the available values if it is
    not found.
  - >-
    C(lanNames) is a list of LAN segment names (strings) that scope which segments
    the assurance policy applies to. Omit or leave empty to apply to all LAN segments.
    When specified, each name is validated against the LAN segments that exist in the
    enterprise; the module fails with an error listing the available values if any is
    not found.
  - >-
    Under C(apps), each entry represents one application to assure or block. Use
    C(profileName) (human-readable string such as V(Graphiant_Assured) or V(Threat_Blocked))
    to specify the assurance profile — the module resolves it to the corresponding integer
    C(bucketId). Use C(builtinAppId) (Graphiant built-in application ID) or C(customAppId)
    (enterprise custom application ID) to identify the application. C(useAllServers) (bool)
    and C(servers) (list of C({ip, port, protocol})) further scope to specific back-end servers.
  - >-
    App name validation and auto-fill: for each app the module looks up the app C(name) in its
    profile's bucket (bucket-apps API, keyed by C(profileName)/C(bucketId) over a ~30-day
    window). It validates the C(name) exists in that bucket and auto-fills C(isDomain),
    C(builtinAppId), and C(customAppId) from the matched bucket app when they are not provided
    (values you supply always take precedence). It also auto-fills C(servers)
    (C({ip, port, protocol})) from the bucket-app-servers telemetry when you do not provide any.
    If the bucket returns no apps for the window, the module fails with an error since the app
    name cannot be validated.
  - >-
    Validation and telemetry auto-fill apply to new apps. When updating an existing policy, an
    app already present in it reuses its currently stored servers/hints for any field you did not
    set, and the telemetry lookup is skipped — so re-running C(configure) with an unchanged config
    stays idempotent even though telemetry is time-windowed and can drift.

      - Path to the Data Assurance YAML config file.
      - Can be an absolute path or relative to the configured config_path.
      - >-
        Supported top-level keys are C(DataAssurancePolicies) (assurance and block-by-URL/app
        policies) and C(ContentFilterPolicies) (block-by-category policies). Both are optional
        lists; either or both may be present.
      - >-
        Each C(DataAssurancePolicies) entry is either an assurance policy (includes C(flexAlgo))
        or a block/protection policy (omits C(flexAlgo)), sent to the assurances endpoint. Each
        C(ContentFilterPolicies) entry blocks domain C(categories) and is sent to the
        content-filters endpoint.
      - Each entry must have at minimum a C(name) field.

      - C(configure) creates or updates policies listed under C(DataAssurancePolicies).
        Idempotent — skips policies whose live config already matches the desired state.

        C(deconfigure) deletes listed policies (detaches sites and clears apps/rules via an
        update, then deletes). Idempotent — skips policies not found.

    support: full
    details: >
      In check mode, no writes are sent to the portal, but the module still reads current
      policy state to determine whether changes would be made. Payloads that would be sent
      are logged with a C([check_mode]) prefix when O(detailed_logs) is enabled.
  diff_mode:
    description: Supports Ansible's C(--diff) for pending Data Assurance policy updates.
    support: full
    details: >
      When run with C(--diff) and at least one policy would change, the module returns a
      C(diff) dictionary (C(before) / C(after) strings). Structured entries are also in
      C(details.diff_plan), each with C(policy), C(action), C(before), and C(after).
