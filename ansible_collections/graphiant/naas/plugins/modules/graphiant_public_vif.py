short_description: Manage Graphiant gateway Public VIF (local data exchange) services
description:
  - Manages gateway Public VIF services — a producer LAN segment (VRF) exposed over BGP through
    one or more Graphiant-managed gateways, in a chosen cloud region/provider, to a cloud router
    and to one or more consumer LAN segments.
  - Supports creating, updating, and deleting services.
version_added: "26.8.0"
extends_documentation_fragment:
  - graphiant.naas.graphiant_portal_auth
notes:
  - "Configuration files support Jinja2 templating syntax for dynamic configuration generation."
  - >-
    Names given for I(lanSegment), I(region), I(advertisement.sites), and
    I(advertisement.siteLists) are resolved to IDs.
  - >-
    I(gatewayBgpNeighbors) (per-gateway BGP peering) and I(natPrefixStrategy) (per-gateway NAT
    prefix) share the same key space — the gateway device name or ID — and every key in one
    should have a matching entry in the other. I(consumerLanSegments) is a separate key space,
    keyed by consumer LAN segment name. See C(sample_public_vif_services.yaml).
  - >-
    Before any write, each configured gateway is checked against what's actually provisioned
    for the resolved I(region)/I(storageProvider); each neighbor's I(localInterface) is checked
    against that gateway's real interfaces; and the resolved I(lanSegment) is checked against
    what's configured on those gateways. A bad reference fails fast with a clear error instead
    of a confusing API rejection or a silently wrong VRF.
  - >-
    Each I(gatewayBgpNeighbors) entry's C(enabled)/C(bfd) fields are not user-configurable —
    the module always enables the neighbor and disables BFD (not yet supported for Public VIF).
  - >-
    Vault (create_services/update_services only): O(vault_public_vif_bgp_md5_passwords), keyed
    by C(service name) -> C(gateway name), fills a neighbor's C(md5Password) when left null in
    YAML (YAML value wins if set). Load from an encrypted vault file with
    M(ansible.builtin.include_vars) (no_log true); see I(configs/vault_secrets.yml.example).
    C(md5Password), from either source, is always redacted as C(********) in logs and C(--diff).
  - "V(create_services)/V(delete_services) are idempotent, matched by I(serviceName)."
  - >-
    V(update_services) is a full replace, not a merge — the config must contain the complete
    desired service; anything omitted (a field, or a I(gatewayBgpNeighbors)/
    I(consumerLanSegments)/I(natPrefixStrategy) entry) is removed. It does not compare against
    live state first, so every run reports C(changed=true) — see
    C(sample_public_vif_services_update.yaml).
  - >-
    Check mode (C(--check)) validates and resolves everything normally; only the write is
    skipped, with the payload logged under a C([check_mode]) prefix.
  - "Use M(graphiant.naas.graphiant_public_vif_info) to query service summaries and details."
options:
  operation:
    description:
      - "The specific Public VIF operation to perform."
      - >-
        V(create_services)/V(update_services): Create or update services from a YAML file
        containing a I(public_vif_services) list. Each service needs a I(serviceName); the
        producer I(lanSegment), I(region), and I(storageProvider) (cloud provider) for the
        gateways; one or more I(gatewayBgpNeighbors) (peer IP/ASN, local interface, timers,
        route filters, MD5 password per gateway); a matching I(natPrefixStrategy) entry per
        gateway (the public NAT prefix advertised to the cloud); and I(consumerLanSegments)
        (which LAN segments may use this Public VIF, and what they advertise over it).
      - >-
        Optional I(coveringPrefixes) summarizes the LAN routes advertised, and
        I(advertisement) scopes which sites/site lists may consume the service (all symmetric
        sites if omitted). V(update_services) requires the service to already exist and
        supports C(--check)/C(--diff) to preview the payload that would be sent.
      - "V(delete_services): Delete Public VIF services from a YAML configuration file."
      - >-
        For query operations (services_summary, service_details), use
        M(graphiant.naas.graphiant_public_vif_info) instead.

      - >-
        Keys must match the service C(name) and the device name/ID key used under that
        service's I(gatewayBgpNeighbors) in the config. Optional; used only when a
