module: graphiant_bgp
short_description: Manage Graphiant BGP peering, routing policies, and route aggregations
description:
  - This module provides comprehensive BGP peering and routing policy management for Graphiant Edge devices.
  - Supports BGP peering neighbor configuration and deconfiguration.
  - Enables attachment and detachment of global BGP routing policies (filters) to BGP peers.
  - Supports BGP route aggregation configuration per LAN segment.
  - Neighbors and aggregations are independent — a segment can define either or both.
  - Supports enabling/disabling eBGP multipath per LAN segment via a segment C(ebgpMultipath) field.
  - Configuration files support Jinja2 templating for dynamic generation.
version_added: "25.12.0"
notes:
  - "BGP Operations:"
  - "  - Configure (state: present): Create BGP peering neighbors, route aggregations, and attach routing policies."
  - "  - Deconfigure (state: absent): Remove BGP peering neighbors and route aggregations. Policies are detached."
  - "  - Detach Policies: Detach global BGP routing policies from BGP peers without removing the peers or aggregations."
  - "Per-entry removal: within V(configure), an individual neighbor or aggregation marked with"
  - "  C(state: absent) in the config file is removed while all other entries are configured normally,"
  - "  so a single peer/aggregation can be deleted without a full deconfigure."
  - "Per-policy detach: within V(configure), set a neighbor filter field"
  - "  (C(ipv4InboundFilter), C(ipv4OutboundFilter), C(ipv6InboundFilter), C(ipv6OutboundFilter))"
  - "  to C(absent) to detach just that routing policy while keeping the neighbor and its other settings."
  - "  Omitting a filter field leaves the currently attached policy unchanged."
  - "Config-file fields use camelCase (e.g. C(remoteIpv4Address), C(peerAs), C(lanSegment), C(bgpAggregations))."
  - "  The original snake_case field names (C(remote_ipv4_address), C(peer_as), ...) are still accepted as"
  - "  aliases for backward compatibility; when both forms are given the camelCase value wins."
  - "Configuration files support Jinja2 templating syntax for dynamic configuration generation."
  - "The module automatically resolves device names, site names, and policy names to IDs."
  - "All operations are idempotent and safe to run multiple times."
  - "Global BGP filters must be created using M(graphiant.naas.graphiant_global_config) module"
  - "before attaching to BGP peers."
  - "BGP Aggregation config file fields per segment entry:"
  - "  bgpAggregations: list of aggregation entries, each with:"
  - "    prefix (required): The network prefix to aggregate, e.g. 1.1.1.0/27."
  - "    asSet (optional, default false): Include AS set information in the aggregated route."
  - "    summaryOnly (optional, default false): Suppress advertisement of more-specific routes."
  - "    state (optional): Set to 'absent' to remove just this aggregation under V(configure)."
  - "  Neighbor entries likewise accept state: absent to remove a single peer under V(configure)."

  detailed_logs:
    description:
      - Enable detailed logging output for troubleshooting and monitoring.
      - When enabled, provides comprehensive logs of all BGP operations.
      - Logs are captured and included in the result_msg for display using M(ansible.builtin.debug) module.

  vault_bgp_peering_md5_passwords:
    description:
      - Dict of device name to BGP neighbor address to MD5 password (configure only).
      - Fills a neighbor's MD5 password from Ansible Vault only when C(md5Password) is null/absent
        in the config file; a non-null value in the config always wins.
      - Pass from playbook vars loaded from an encrypted I(vault_secrets.yml); secrets stay in memory.
      - Keys must match the device name and the neighbor C(remoteIpv4Address) in the BGP config.

attributes:
  check_mode:
    description: Full check mode support with per-device state comparison.
    support: full
    details: >
      The module fetches each device's current BGP state and compares it against the desired
      configuration. In check mode the same comparison runs, but the config push is skipped;
      V(changed) reflects whether a push would have occurred. Devices already in the desired
      state are reported under RV(skipped_devices) and do not count as changes.
  diff_mode:
    description: Supports diff mode; shows per-device before/after BGP state when run with C(--diff).
    support: full

requirements:
  - python >= 3.7
  - graphiant-sdk >= 26.8.0
